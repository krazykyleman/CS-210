# CS-210-Kyle-W


Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

- This was a clock that you could edit and it would display the time in both a 12 and a 24 hour format. Very interesting as an exercise.
  
  
What did you do particularly well?

- I think the syntax looks nice. I'm not sure of the speed of the code or if it code have been done better.
  
  
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

- I'm not exactly sure. This project was fairly simple and was all on one file, it's kind of hard to imagine making it run more effectively. I guess I would change the way I made the seconds pass. I made fake time, as in I called the add seconds function everytime a button is pressed so it looks like time is going by.
  
  
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

- All of this code was hard to write. The whole class was irritabilly difficult. I would use the ZyBook reading material and some help from Google when I faced an error or didn't know how to handle certain parts of the project.
  
  
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

- This was the first project we had to do. It helped me learn case loops and how to create a menu with C++. All the other projects required menu loops, so this helped a lot.
  
  
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

- I have a way that I like to format. I find a new way with each language I learn, I think that it looks good to me and is easily readable. I also like to leave comments to people can read what my intentions were and improve upon them.
